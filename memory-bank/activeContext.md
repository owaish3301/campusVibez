# Active Context: CampusVibe

## Current Work Focus
- Moving into Phase 3: Home Page (Ask & Answer) implementation
- Need to design and implement the question asking/answering interface
- Planning the compatibility-based question sorting system

## Recent Changes
- Completed Phase 2: Authentication & Onboarding
- Implemented multi-step onboarding wizard using:
  - react-hook-form for form management
  - Zod for form validation
  - Framer Motion for smooth transitions
  - Shadcn UI components for consistent design
- Enhanced user profile data structure in Firestore
- Added extensive form validation and error handling
- Implemented progressive form completion with step validation

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Begin Phase 3 - Home Page Development:**
   - Design and implement the "Ask a Question" interface
   - Create the question feed UI for answering questions
   - Implement the daily question limit logic
   - Develop the basic compatibility sorting algorithm
   - Set up Firestore queries for question filtering

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Using react-hook-form + Zod for robust form handling
- Using Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions
- Implementing step-by-step form validation
- Storing rich user profile data for future compatibility matching
- Client-side compatibility sorting for initial implementation

## Key Patterns & Preferences
### Component Patterns:
- Multi-step form wizard with progressive validation
- Reusable form sections for organized data collection
- Gradient text and backgrounds for visual appeal
- Animated transitions between form steps
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Data Management:
- Structured Firestore documents for user profiles
- Form state management using react-hook-form
- Zod schemas for type-safe form validation
- Real-time form validation with error messages

### UI/UX Patterns:
- Progress indicator for multi-step forms
- Gradient CTAs and accents
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Clear error messages and validation feedback
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Learnings & Insights
- Multi-step form implementation with validation provides better UX
- Rich form validation improves data quality
- Structured data in Firestore will help with future features
- Animation adds polish but needs performance consideration
- Breaking down complex forms into sections improves maintainability
