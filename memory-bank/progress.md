# Progress Tracking

## Current Status
- Phase 1 (Setup) is complete
- Phase 2 (Authentication & Onboarding) is significantly enhanced
  - Added comprehensive security measures
  - Implemented proper error handling
  - Added session management
- Phase 3 (Home Page) implementation continues
  - UI components complete
  - Firebase integration pending

## What Works
### Infrastructure & Security
- Comprehensive Firestore security rules
- Rate limiting implementation
- Session persistence
- Protected routes with guards
- Offline detection
- Error boundaries

### Authentication & User Management
- Google OAuth with proper session handling
- Email verification flow
- Route protection with authentication checks
- Session timeout management
- Rate limiting for auth attempts

### Error Handling & UX
- Global error boundary with fallback UI
- Toast notification system
- Offline mode detection
- Loading states
- Error recovery mechanisms

### State Management
- Auth context with proper state handling
- Toast notification context
- Offline state management
- Form state persistence

## What's Left to Build
### Authentication & Security
- [ ] Implement password strength requirements
- [ ] Add email verification UI
- [ ] Set up proper session timeout UI
- [ ] Implement account recovery flow

### Error Handling & UX
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] Implement offline sync queue
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error messages
- [ ] Improve loading state granularity

### Cache & Performance
- [ ] Implement data caching strategy
- [ ] Add lazy loading for routes
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement infinite scrolling

### Firebase Integration
- [ ] Connect question creation to Firestore
- [ ] Set up real-time question feed
- [ ] Implement answer submission
- [ ] Add daily question limit tracking

## Recent Improvements
### Security
- Added comprehensive Firestore security rules
- Implemented rate limiting
- Added session management
- Set up route protection

### Error Handling
